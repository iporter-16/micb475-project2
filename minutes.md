Overall project goal: perform weighted unifrac analysis on the Columbian dataset, looking at metadata categories previously [shown](https://ojs.library.ubc.ca/index.php/UJEMI/article/view/198186/192791?fbclid=IwAR0iTZopMvDnj4u4ff_Y713ByjeSGnvi86pGAkuLxliEXvQDzXDXm4_k-OA) to be significant in ÃŸ diversity analysis. 

Hope to identify the confounding variable demonstrated in a prior student [paper](https://ojs.library.ubc.ca/index.php/UJEMI/article/view/198169?fbclid=IwAR2YNekj_Vk7d4nClvOmYG3rJulVkaPYJ1Y8h8GdXCUovs8sDr9Kn98OMaA).

Will begin by looking at city, fibre intake, sex, medication.

Question: what is the confounding variable that causes the population clustering seen above?

**Action items:** start QIIME processing (Sam, with group helping!) + begin project proposal
