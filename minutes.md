## Oct 2
Overall project goal: perform weighted unifrac analysis on the Columbian dataset, looking at metadata categories previously [shown](https://ojs.library.ubc.ca/index.php/UJEMI/article/view/198186/192791?fbclid=IwAR0iTZopMvDnj4u4ff_Y713ByjeSGnvi86pGAkuLxliEXvQDzXDXm4_k-OA) to be significant in ß diversity analysis. 

Hope to identify the confounding variable demonstrated in a prior student [paper](https://ojs.library.ubc.ca/index.php/UJEMI/article/view/198169?fbclid=IwAR2YNekj_Vk7d4nClvOmYG3rJulVkaPYJ1Y8h8GdXCUovs8sDr9Kn98OMaA). Will begin by looking at city, fibre intake, sex, medication. Perform unweighted unifrac analysis as the students did for the original paper, and assess clustering based on these variables (previously noted to have a significant impact on ß diversity metrics) to see if one is responsible for the pattern observed.

Question: what is the confounding variable that causes the population clustering seen above?

**Action items:** start QIIME processing (Sam, with group helping!) + begin project proposal

## Oct 5 (Agenda)
Our options: look for confounding variables (above), or use piecrust for metabolic analysis (fatty acid metabolism)

Things to decide upon: timeline/process, assigning roles and draft deadlines.
